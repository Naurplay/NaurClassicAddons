**What steps will reproduce the problem?**
<!-- Describe what you clicked or did when the problem occured -->

**What is the expected output? What do you see instead?**
<!-- What did you expect to happen and what happened instead? -->

**Did you try having WeakAuras as the only enabled addon and everything else (especially something like ElvUI) disabled?**
<!-- Testing with only WeakAuras enabled is crucial to ruling out conflicts with other addons. -->

**Which version of WeakAuras are you using?**
<!-- You can see the current version in the title bar of the options window, if the options do not open, check the Twitch app or the `## Version:` field in the WeakAuras.toc file -->

**Was it working in a previous version? If yes, which was the last good one?**
<!-- You can always find older versions of WeakAuras to test with at https://www.wowace.com/projects/weakauras-2/files -->

**Do you have an error log of what happened?** 
<!-- If you don't see any errors, make sure that error reporting is enabled (`/console scriptErrors 1`) or install https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bugsack & https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/bug-grabber, yes both are needed. 
Note that if the error looks like `[string "--[[ Error in ' my awesome aura' ]` then the bug is in the aura that got mentioned, not in WeakAuras itself -->
