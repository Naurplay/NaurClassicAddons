Reporting issues
----------------
Issues submitted [here](https://github.com/kesava-wow/kuinameplates2/issues) won't necessarily receive a response, but I do read all of them. If you just want to ask a question or get in touch with me, the comments on [Curse](http://mods.curse.com/addons/WoW/kuinameplates) are a better option. I (usually) try to respond to all of those.

When submitting an issue:
- Separate distinct issues into multiple tickets. It's easier to work with that way.
- Run this in chat: ``/knp dump``. It should open a window including some debug information. Copy that into your report; it tells me what version of KNP you're on, what your current profile's settings are, and what modules are installed.
- Remember I'm human. Though I do main a Draenei.
